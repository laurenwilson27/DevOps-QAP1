# Lauren Wilson - DevOps QAP1

A repository demonstrating basic unit tests for the SuggestionEngine class written by Jamie Cornick (https://github.com/jamie-keyin/Keyin-JUnit-Demo/tree/master)  
In addition to the master branch, there is also a [breaking-change](https://github.com/laurenwilson27/DevOps-QAP1/tree/breaking-change) branch containing changes which cause tests to fail, to demonstrate the use of GitHub actions.
